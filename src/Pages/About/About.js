        Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was involved in a variety of
        projects. Some of these included Obstacle Size/Distance Finding /
        Creative Warning Walking Stick for Blind People and Universal Remote
        Controller. I have also completed two internships. One of the internship
        was at the company ALTINAY Aerospace & Advanced Technologies, majored in
        the electronics and control department. The other one was in AltÄ±nay
        ModCenter's R&D department. I learned teamwork, technical knowledge, and
        effective literature review techniques as a result of these projects.
        After my undergraduate, I had started to work at Slimstock as a Software
        support specialist almost for two years. Since May 2022, I've been
        working as a Software Test Engineer for NTT DATA Business Solutions
        Turkey.
